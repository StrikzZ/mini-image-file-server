## Usage

Besides using the built-in web interface to upload and manage files,  
you can also interact with the server over CLI â€” for example using `curl`.

### Uploading a file via `curl`

The `/upload` endpoint accepts a single file through a multipart form request:

```bash
curl -X POST http://<your-server>/upload -F "file=@example.png"
```

This will return a JSON response containing metadata and access URLs, for example:
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1",
  "page_url": "http://<your-server>/i/a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1",
  "raw_url": "http://<your-server>/raw/image/a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1"
}
```

You can also retrieve JSON listings of existing uploads:
```bash
curl http://<your-server>/list/images
curl http://<your-server>/list/files
```

## Developing

### **VS Code Dev Container (for quick start)**

The repo includes a full `.devcontainer` setup for Visual Studio Code.  

**Quick Start:**
1. Open the repo in VS Code and follow the Dev Container prompts (reopen in container).
2. This should start the whole dev stack. If it doesn't start automatically, run `docker-compose` up manually.
3. Adjust Compose environment as needed.

## Features

- Lightweight **FastAPI-based file and image server** designed for easy self-hosting.  
- Supports **uploads of images and archive files** (e.g. JPG, PNG, GIF, WEBP, ZIP, TAR, RAR, 7Z) with automatic MIME detection via **magic-bytes** - no reliance on file extensions.  
- Generates a simple **web interface** to view uploaded images and manage files with built-in previews and download links.  
- Includes automatic **file expiration and cleanup** after a configurable number of days (`TTL_DAYS`).  
- Can be securely deployed **behind Auth services as well as reverse proxy services**, with trusted host and proxy-header support.  
- Provides **JSON API endpoints** for listing, retrieving, and uploading files - suitable for integration with other apps or dashboards.
