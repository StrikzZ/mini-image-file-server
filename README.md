## Usage

Besides using the built-in web interface to upload and manage files,  
you can also interact with the server over CLI ‚Äî for example using `curl`.

### Uploading a file via `curl`

The `/upload` endpoint accepts a single file through a multipart form request:

```bash
curl -X POST https://<your-server>/upload -F "file=@example.png"
```

This will return a JSON response containing metadata and access URLs, for example:
```json
{
  "type": "image",
  "id": "a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1",
  "page_url": "https://<your-server>/i/a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1",
  "raw_url": "https://<your-server>/raw/image/a9d8b4e7c3f24e0f8b6a1d9f6a34bcd1"
}
```

You can also retrieve JSON listings of existing uploads:
```bash
curl https://<your-server>/list/images
curl https://<your-server>/list/files
```

## Developing

### **VS Code Dev Container (for quick start)**

The repo includes a full `.devcontainer` setup for Visual Studio Code.  

**Quick Start:**
1. Open the repo in VS Code and follow the Dev Container prompts (reopen in container).
2. This should start the whole dev stack. If it doesn't start automatically, run `docker-compose` up manually.
3. Adjust Compose environment as needed.
